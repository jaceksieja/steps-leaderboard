According to the task description, I focused on showing craftmanship over functionality

2. Run `docker compose build --no-cache` to build fresh images
3. Run `docker compose up --pull always -d --wait` to start the project
4. Open `https://localhost` in your favorite web browser and [accept the auto-generated TLS certificate](https://stackoverflow.com/a/15076602/1352334)
5. Run `docker compose down --remove-orphans` to stop the Docker containers.
